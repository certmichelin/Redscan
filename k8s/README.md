Redscan-K8S is a hybrid implementation of the Redscan system that leverages Kubernetes and standalone servers within the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. 

This setup combines the flexibility and scalability of Kubernetes orchestration with the dedicated performance of standalone servers. Kubernetes is used to manage containerized applications, ensuring efficient deployment, scaling, and operations of Redscan components. Standalone servers provide robust and reliable resources for tasks that require consistent performance and direct hardware access. 

Together, this hybrid approach optimizes resource utilization, enhances scalability, and maintains high performance for Redscanâ€™s security scanning and monitoring functions in the Azure environment.
